**UDACITY - ALX Full-Stack Developer Nanodegree program.**  
**Project 1️⃣**

## Overview   
This project is an API that can be used in two different ways namely;  
**1️⃣ As a Simple Placeholder API:** allows a user to place images into their frontend with the width and height set via URL parameters for rapid prototyping.  
**2️⃣ As a Library:** to serve properly scaled versions of images to the front end to reduce page load size rather than needing to resize and upload multiple copies of the same image to be used throughout the site.
